# Bank of Flatiron

## Project Overview

The **Bank of Flatiron** is a React web application designed to manage and display bank transactions. The application allows users to view a list of transactions, add new transactions, filter transactions, and optionally sort and delete them.

## Learning Goals

- Practice React components, props, state, events, and data fetching.
- Implement a mini web app with functional and reusable components.

## Features

### Core Features

- **Transaction Table**: Displays a list of all transactions.
- **Add Transaction Form**: Allows users to add new transactions to the table (note: transactions are not persisted to the backend).
- **Search Functionality**: Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions matching the search term are shown.
